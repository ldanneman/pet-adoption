        As the leader in the no-kill movement, North Shore Animal League America
        is committed to saving and rehabilitating the lives of homeless animals
        and educating the public about the joys and responsibilities of rescue.
        Founded in 1944, we’re the world’s largest, most comprehensive no-kill
        rescue and adoption organization. We are headquartered in Port
        Washington, N.Y. with 2,000 shelter partners across the country and
        around the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conduct local, national, international, puppy mill and emergency
        rescues. We respond to calls from shelter and rescue groups that are
        forced to destroy animals as a means of population control, and we
        respond to the cries of so many dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens in
        peril that count on us to save their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide a high level of care to every animal that we rescue, to help
        ready that pet for adoption. In a single year our staff performed 85,000
        exams and vaccinated 65,000 animals.
      </p>
      <p>
        We place nearly 18,000 pets annually into responsible, loving homes,
        plus assist in the adoptions of thousands more through our global
        partnerships. Over the years, we’ve introduced such life-saving best
        practices as mobile adoption and national low-cost spay/neuter referral
        services and humane relocation programs.
